# Frontend Mentor - Audiophile e-commerce website solution

This is a solution to the [Audiophile e-commerce website challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/audiophile-ecommerce-website-C8cuSd_wx). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

This is the second version of this website. The first was build with vite and used React Router for routing and useContext for state management. This version is built with next.js and uses its app router for routing and Redux Toolkit for state mangement.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
